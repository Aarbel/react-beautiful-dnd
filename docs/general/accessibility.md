# Accessibility ‚ôøÔ∏è

Traditionally drag and drop interactions have been exclusively a mouse or touch interaction. This library ships with support for drag and drop interactions [**using only a keyboard**](/docs/sensor/keyboard.md). This enables power users to drive their experience entirely from the keyboard. Keyboard dragging also opens up drag and drop experiences to people who would have been excluded previously.

We provide **fantastic support for screen readers** to assist users with visual (or other) impairments. We ship with english messaging out of the box üì¶. However, you are welcome to override these messages by using the `announce` function that it provided to all of the `<DragDropContext /> > responder` functions.

See our [screen reader guide](/docs/guides/screen-reader.md) for a guide on controlling and crafting useful screen reader messaging.
